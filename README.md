### About Me 
I am a software engineer with a background in the music industry. At my core, I am an organized thinker that loves problem solving. While in music, I developed both of these skills through finding creative and efficient ways to bring artists to market and, as a software engineer, I utilize these skills through creative and efficient ways to develop reliable applications. I am passionate about contributing to work that I am proud of and that benefits society, and look forward to life's challenges or error messages as an opportunity for growth.
