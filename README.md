### About Me 
I am a Software Engineer, Sr. Manager, Creator Acquisition and Development at Twitch, and podcast host with a background in the music industry. At my core, I am an organized thinker that loves problem-solving.

While in music, I developed both of these skills by finding creative and efficient ways to bring artists to market, and at Twitch, I utilize these skills to help our partners find success on the service. As an engineer, I apply them through innovative and productive ways to develop applications. As a podcast host, I have 80+ episodes and two years of experience interviewing the music industry‚Äôs most innovative minds and building a community of engaged listeners.

I am devoted to contributing to work that I am proud of and benefits society, and I look forward to life's challenges or error messages as an opportunity for growth.
